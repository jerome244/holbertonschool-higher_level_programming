Description


Background Context
Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, let’s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

BTW, have you ever modified a variable without knowing it or wanting to? I mean:

>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
>>> 
OK. But what about this?

>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> m = l
>>> l[0] = 'x'
>>> m
['x', 2, 3]
>>> 



This project is a little bit different than the usual projects. The first part is only questions about Python’s specificity like “What would be the result of…”. You should read all documentation first (as usual :)), then take the time to think and brainstorm about what you think and why. Try to do this without coding anything for a few hours.

Trying examples in the Python interpreter will give you most of the answers without having to think about it. Don’t go this route. First read, then think, then brainstorm. Only then you can test in the interpreter.

It’s important that you truly understand the reasons behind the answers of all those tasks so that you can apply the same logic to other variables and other variable types.

Note that during interviews for Python positions, you will most likely have to answer to these type of questions.

All your answers should be only one line in a file. No space before or after the answer.

29. Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!
mandatory
Write a blog post about everything you just learned / this project is covering. Your blog post should be articulated this way (one paragraph per item):

introduction
id and type
mutable objects
immutable objects
why does it matter and how differently does Python treat mutable and immutable objects
how arguments are passed to functions and what does that imply for mutable and immutable objects
If you worked on advanced tasks, please also include what you did learn in those tasks in the blog post.

Your posts should have many code/output examples to illustrate what you are explaining, and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on LinkedIn.

When done, please add all urls below (blog post, LinkedIn post, etc.)

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.
