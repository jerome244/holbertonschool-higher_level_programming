# JavaScript DOM Manipulation

This project contains several exercises to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation and basic web API requests.

## How to Test Your Code

### Option 1: Open with Live Server (Recommended)

1. **Install the Live Server extension** in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
   - Go to the Extensions tab and search for "Live Server".
   - Click Install.

2. **Open your project folder** in VS Code.
   - Example: `holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/javascript-dom_manipulation`

3. **Open the HTML file you want to test** (such as `0-main.html`, `1-main.html`, etc.).

4. **Start Live Server:**
   - Right-click on the HTML file and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
   - Or click the **"Go Live"** button at the bottom right of VS Code.

5. **A browser window will open automatically**, displaying your HTML page. Any changes you save will update automatically in the browser.

### Option 2: Open HTML Directly in Browser

1. **Navigate to your project folder** using your computer’s file explorer.

2. **Find the HTML file** you want to test (for example, `4-main.html`).

3. **Double-click the file**, or right-click and choose **"Open with"** → your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome).

4. **Manually refresh** the page after making changes to your code.

## Project Structure

- Each main task has its own JavaScript file (e.g., `0-script.js`, `1-script.js`, etc.).
- Example test HTML files are provided (e.g., `0-main.html`, `1-main.html`) to help you verify your scripts.
- **Scripts are automatically loaded by the HTML files** via the `<script src="..."></script>` tag.

## Notes

- All scripts use modern JavaScript (`let`/`const`, no `var`).
- No page reload is needed for DOM manipulation.
- If you use Live Server, changes are updated automatically as you save your files.

Happy coding!
